# Weather_Analysis_API_Hw6
Week 6 project was intresting as it taught us how to get data using it to API and analyize it with python.  I was tasked with creating a Python script with the help of mulitiple Python libraries in order to perform API calls to Open Weather Map's API to retrieve weather information. 
With the information retrieved, I was able to create a series of scatter plots to demonstrate the relationships between 

1) temperature vs. latitude
2) humidity vs. latitude
3) cloudiness vs. latitude
4) wind speed vs. latitude
